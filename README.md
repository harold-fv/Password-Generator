# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## Description

When the users clicks a button to generate a password, they will be  presented with series of prompts for password criteria. The input is then validated and at least one character type must be selected. Once all prompts are answered, a password is generated based on the selected criteria and is either displayed in an alert or written to the page. This kind of system improves the system security by providing employees with a very strong and randomly generated password.
